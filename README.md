Our attempt at the kaggle competition [novozymes enzyme stability prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction)

This competition is about predicting the stability of enzymes. The stability of an enzyme is defined as the time it takes for the enzyme to lose 50% of its activity. The dataset consist of 2,413 proteins consisting of different mutations of the same enzyme. We will they try to predict the effect of mutations on the stability of the enzyme.
